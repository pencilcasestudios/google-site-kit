Site Kit is is a one-stop solution for WordPress users to use everything Google has to offer to make them successful on the web.

It provides authoritative, up-to-date insights from multiple Google products directly on the WordPress dashboard for easy access.

Site Kit shows key metrics and insights from four different Google products:

* **Search Console:** Understand how Google’s systems discover and render your pages. Track how many people saw your site in Search results, and for what queries.
* **Analytics:** See how users navigate across your site and if they complete the goals you have set as conversions.
* **AdSense:** Keep track of how much your site is earning you. Or if you haven’t yet, make your good content work for you by setting up an AdSense account.
* **PageSpeed Insights:** See how your pages perform compared to other real-world sites. Improve performance with actionable tips from PageSpeed Insights.

* Select which services you want to connect -- so you only track what you actually need.
* View metrics and insights for your entire site or for a single post.
* Compare how metrics from different services correlate over different time periods.
* Provide your site's authors and contributors insights over their individual posts.
